A first word

Responsive web design is incredibly important. However, teamwork is essential as well. That's why you'll be working on this exercise in pairs.
Exercise

Make a copy of this website the best you can: https://wowwee.com/.
Find out where to find the files you will need for this and download them into your project folder. (images, icons, backgrounds...)

BABY SHARK DOO DOO DOO

The website has to be responsive for the following screen sizes:

    Small: default CSS (min-width 0px).
    Medium (min-width 768px).
    Large (min-width 1200px).

Bonus:

    Extra large (min-width 1800px)

Some tips to get started:

    Design for mobile first, and build on that.
    Make a checklist of all the features that this site has.

Rules:

    Whatever you do, don't break these few rules.
    You shall only have 1 HTML file, in which the 2 of you will work on at the same time. (This, with a handy plugin.)
    You will provide a style tag inside the HTML (Don't ever do this if we don't request it from you.).
    Do not work in separate files at ANY time.
    Do not copy other learners work or HTML lines (We see everything ;) ).
    Your website has to be responsive.
    Reach your deadline.
