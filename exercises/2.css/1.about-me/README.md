Exercise:

Create an HTML page in which you give a small explanation about yourself.
Note: By following the instructions below.
Section 1: the header

We're going to make a nice header, in which we are going to introduce you.
This ensures that when the page is loaded, we immediately know who, what or where.

Section 2: the section

In our next challenge, we are going to make a table in which we keep a Q&A for you and your colleagues. In the table head we will find the questions, the rows will contain you and your colleagues answers.
(Ask your colleagues their answers via Ryver. Atleast 4 questions.)

Questions:

    What did you do before BeCode?
    Why do you want to become a Web Developer?
    What is your biggest dream?
    What do you expect from your colleagues?
    What do you expect from the training?
    Is there something we should know about you?

Optimization:

Load your html file into lighthouse. Look at the scores and read the feedback, optimize the website so that your scores are as high as possible.
Bonus:
Section 4: The nav-bar

Create a nav-bar at the top of the page. This page should have links to fictional pages. Make this navbar as beautiful as you can and prove to yourself that you already understand HTML & CSS!
Note: If we move the mouse over the buttons, the letters should get a moving animation. (rotate/scale/...).
Be creative!
Provide a markdown file named 'QandA.md' containing those questions + your awnsers.
What happens if...

    We add a 'background-attachment: fixed;' to our header background image?
    We add a linear-gradient over the background image?
    We add a box-shadow to our table?
