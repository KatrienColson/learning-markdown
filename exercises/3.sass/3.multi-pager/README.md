Exercise

As a group of 3 or 4 people, you'll have to make the HTML and CSS for an application: League of Legends Launcher.

As you can see, there is more than one page for the application. You have to make sure that each page properly redirects to the others when the right button is clicked.

At the end of the deadline, we'll go over each group's project. So make sure it's published with GitHub pages.
Rules of the game

    All pages of your project have to make use of the same CSS file.
    This exercise isn't finished until the deadline is reached. So keep making improvements until then!
    At the end of the deadline, every group member has a working copy of the project on their GitHub account.
    This exercise is part of the SASS chapter so obviously you have to use SASS.
