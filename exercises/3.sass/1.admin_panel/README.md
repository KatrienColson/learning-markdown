Exercise

As a group of 3 or 4 people, you'll have to make the HTML and SCSS for an admin panel (adaptiveness included: mobile and desktop!), which you can find here. You only have to make the page that the link directs to.
Rules of the game

    No Bootstrap, only SASS!
    Use partials! Your project should at least contain:
        _reset.scss
        _variables.scss
        _mixins.scss
        _components.scss
        main.scss
    Avoid numbers in classnames!
    Use the exact same colors that are used on the page!

    Applying your knowledge of HTML.
    Applying your knowledge of (S)CSS.
    Learning to code DRY. (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    Learning to resolve git conflicts.
    Learning to work in group effectively.
